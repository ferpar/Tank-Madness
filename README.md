IRONHACK Project #1 Mars2043 Videogame

This game is a project I did while at the Ironhack bootcamp. 

It showcases:

  - An example of simple object oriented programming.
  - The implementation of a UML diagram as a design tool.
  - My first instance of the MVC paradigm: the renderer is separated from the data model.
  - The application of a simple game model.
